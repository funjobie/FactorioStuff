[entity-description]
manual-assembler=This assembler requires a nearby player to craft items (by standing in front of it and looking at it), but it is faster and more productive than hand-crafting. Doesn't work if the player is already hand-crafting. It requires either repair-packs or the Infinity screwdriver to operate.
green-beacon-mk2=This beacon accepts only efficiency modules, but provides the effect in a good range with less than normal energy consumption. This beacon may not overlap with itself, with red moon beacons or with blue energy field beacons.
red-beacon-mk2=During the night, this beacon transmits its productivity bonus to furnaces (other effects are ignored). However during the day affected entities get a speed and productivity de-buff instead. This beacon may not overlap with itself, green sphere beacons or blue energy field beacon.
blue-beacon-mk2=This beacon provides a 50% speed bonus to all miners (burner drill/electric drill/pump-jack) contained within a wall made of concrete energy field or gates. Such surrounded areas may not overlap, and this area may not overlap with red moon beacons or green sphere beacons. Consumes additional electricity depending on field size.
robo-assembler=This assembler crafts using construction robots, which are drained of their energy.

robo-recipe-standardization=Robotic assembly standardization

[technology-description]
infinity-screwdriver-tech=Unlocks the infinity screwdriver, which is a tool for the manual assembler with infinite use.
robo-assembler=Unlocks the robotic assembler, which is used to craft high-tech items. It requires construction robots to craft items. It is recommended to disable personal robots while working nearby, as they will otherwise go over to operate the machine instead.
robo-recipe-standardization=By utilizing the space science results to standardize productions it is now possible to craft high-tech items in regular assemblers. (Use this in the end-game to save UPS)
